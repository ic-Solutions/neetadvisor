## Introduction to KMC Manipal & Mangalore

Manipal, renowned as an international university town, became prominent with the establishment of **Kasturba Medical College (KMC), Manipal**, in 1953. This institution holds the distinction of being India's first self-financing medical college in the private sector. Starting from a barren hillock, it has blossomed into a verdant, modern town, providing an ideal environment for student learning.

Today, KMC Manipal is synonymous with quality medical education, attracting students from across India and the globe. The college consistently ranks among the top ten medical colleges nationwide, with graduates from over 30 countries each year receiving globally recognized degrees.

**Kasturba Medical College, Manipal** and **Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore**, collectively known as KMC, are esteemed constituent units of the **Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE)**, an Institution of Eminence. KMC Manipal is situated within MAHE's sprawling 600-acre campus in the university town of Manipal, a suburb of Udupi, Karnataka. KMC Mangalore, on the other hand, is located in the heart of Mangalore, spanning 313 acres. Both institutions, along with others in Manipal, were consolidated to form MAHE, which was granted deemed university status by the UGC in 1993.

## Admission Process for MBBS

KMC Manipal and KMC Mangalore offer an **MBBS course** with a duration of four and a half years, followed by a compulsory one-year rotating internship.

Admission to the MBBS program is based on the **All-India Rank obtained in NEET UG**, conducted by the NTA. The counselling process is managed by MCC. The course curriculum includes both theory classes and clinical training, adhering to the guidelines set by the NMC (erstwhile MCI).

The admission process can be complex, especially due to the significant intake of foreign and NRI students. For expert guidance through NEET Counselling, students are encouraged to contact **NEET advisor** to leverage their specialized expertise.
