How tough is it to prepare for an exam? How long does it take to make it through? Is it a single step procedure? Or does it have multiple layers? With increasing competition, the chances of making it through NEET in itself is quite tough. 

It is not just about hard work and burning overnight oil now. The admission procedure requires you to put forward your smartest step. NEET is a benchmark when it is about competitive exams. But it does not end at appearing for the exam, qualifying it and getting a fairly decent score?

## Are you working as religiously as your child?

Parents play a vital role in the admission procedure. It is not only about supporting the child, providing funds for their education or motivating them. It is about gathering all the information that your child will need after appearing for the exam. Let them prepare for the exam. 

You, prepare for what comes after it, The counseling procedure. A plethora of coaching institutes are available to help your children with their studies. But we haven&#39;t bailed out on you to handle the non-academic process yourself. NEET ADVISOR will educate and assist you through the counseling procedure at the drop of a hat.

## What should a parent do to ensure their child&#39;s admission?

• A detailed health analysis of medical colleges is what every parent should do. This includes cut-offs, connectivity, facilities, infrastructure, faculty, etc.

• You should be aware of the detailed structure of counseling, AIQ, State or deemed. You should be aware of the domicile requirements, reservation category, language quota, etc. To get any kind of leverage that you can possibly get.

• Prepare early and look beyond. Predict a NEET score. And plan every step of your counseling beforehand.

• Keep the documents handy. Do not wait until the last moment.

• Be well versed in the counseling process. Research, document and educate yourself.

## Do you doubt an effective contribution and involvement from your end?

If you doubt your efficiency and effectiveness in terms of involvement. You&#39;re not alone. With hectic schedules, it is almost impossible for every parent to sufficiently contribute to the cause. 

In a colossal country like India, it is not easy to research about each and every college. In many cases, it is also necessary to visit the colleges to get a better understanding.
