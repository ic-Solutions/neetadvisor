**The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test Post Graduate, abbreviated as NEET PG is the main qualifying entrance and rank determining exam held in India. Every year, it is conducted by the National Board of Examinations operating under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Department of Government of India.

**NEET PG is a computer-based examination and the subjects tested are according to the syllabus laid down by Graduate Medical Education Regulations.

You must have an MBBS degree as per the Indian Medical Council Act to appear for the examination.**

**Presently, there are over 6,102 institutes offering PG medical courses through the NEET PG exam in India, but the precise number of colleges can vary slightly depending on the year and the course.

## NEET PG Eligibility Criteria

**Any student who is carrying out an academic career in India and holds a degree (if the degree is not yet awarded, provisional pass certificate is the requirement) of Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) according to the Indian Act of Medical Council, can apply for the exam.**

**The candidate must also have a valid Indian, or State Medical Council approved MBBS registration certificate.

**For students having graduated from Foreign Medical Colleges, there are two more primary requirements to apply for NEET PG. Firstly, the candidate should register to the Medical Council of India (Central or State) and complete one full year of the internship program.**

## NEET Counselling Eligibility

**MCC shall lay down a particular cut off for the year. Candidates obtaining equal to or more than the qualifying cut off marks laid down by the MCC, will be eligible to attend the NEET Counselling (PG) procedure. Though the cut off is subject to regular annual change by the MCC, it stays close around 270-320 for General candidates and somewhere near 220-290 for the reserved quota.**
